# Hey there, web developers! Today, I'm diving into why Drupal might just be the best choice for your next website project. You've probably heard of it, but let's break down why it stands out.

First off, Drupal is incredibly flexible. Whether you're building a small blog or a massive enterprise site, Drupal can handle it. It's like a Swiss Army knife for web development.

With thousands of modules, you can extend and customize your site to do almost anything. Need a complex content workflow? There's a module for that. Want to integrate with third-party services? Drupal has you covered.

Now, let's talk about security. Drupal has a dedicated security team that constantly monitors and updates the platform. This means your site is in good hands, even when new vulnerabilities pop up. You can rest easy knowing that your data—and your users' data—are safe.

Another big plus is Drupal's performance. It's built to handle high-traffic sites with ease. Whether you need caching, load balancing, or search optimization, Drupal's core and its modules are optimized for speed and efficiency. So if you're expecting a lot of visitors, Drupal won't let you down.

Let's not forget about the Drupal community—another reason to love this platform. There's a massive, active community of developers contributing to its growth. If you have a question, chances are someone has already answered it in a forum or blog post. With regular updates and improvements, Drupal keeps getting better and better.

And when it comes to content management, Drupal's system is top-notch. It's powerful and flexible, allowing you to create and manage your content with ease. From simple text to complex multimedia, Drupal handles it all seamlessly.

Finally, let's talk scalability. Starting small but planning to grow? Drupal scales with your business. You can start with a basic setup and expand as needed without having to switch platforms.

So, there you have it: flexibility, security, performance, community support, content management, and scalability. These are just a few reasons why Drupal is a fantastic choice for your next website.

Give it a try and see how it can transform your web development experience. Thanks for watching, and happy coding!

## Building a Drupal Website Using Lagoon Docker, Ubuntu, VS Code, and Drupal Core (Project: ay-tech)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your Ubuntu system. You can follow these commands to install Docker:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

2. **Install Docker Compose**: Lagoon uses Docker Compose, so you need that as well:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Install VS Code**: If you haven't installed VS Code yet, you can do so by following these steps:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget
   wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install code
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Lagoon

1. **Clone Lagoon Repository**:
   - Clone the Lagoon repository to set up the Docker environment for your Drupal project.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon.git
   cd lagoon
   ```

2. **Configure Your Project (ay-tech)**:
   - In the Lagoon directory, create a folder for your project "ay-tech". Lagoon uses Docker Compose files for configuration.
   ```bash
   mkdir ay-tech
   cd ay-tech
   ```

3. **Create Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for your project. Here's a sample configuration for Drupal:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.6'
   services:
     web:
       image: lagoon/php:7.4-fpm
       volumes:
         - ./:/app
       ports:
         - "8080:80"
       environment:
         LAGOON_PROJECT: ay-tech
     db:
       image: lagoon/mariadb
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
         MYSQL_DATABASE: drupal
   ```

### Step 3: Download Drupal Core

1. **Get Drupal Core**:
   - Download Drupal core into your "ay-tech" project folder.
   ```bash
   composer create-project drupal/recommended-project .
   ```

2. **Update `settings.php`**:
   - Configure your `settings.php` file to match the database details from your Docker Compose file.
   ```php
   $databases['default']['default'] = [
     'driver' => 'mysql',
     'database' => 'drupal',
     'username' => 'root',
     'password' => 'example',
     'host' => 'db',
     'port' => '3306',
   ];
   ```

### Step 4: Start Your Development Environment

1. **Bring Up Your Environment**:
   - Use Docker Compose to bring up your development environment.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access Your Site**:
   - You should be able to access your Drupal site at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 5: Develop with VS Code

1. **Open Your Project in VS Code**:
   - Navigate to your "ay-tech" directory and open it in VS Code.
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. **Start Coding**:
   - Use VS Code to develop your custom modules or themes as needed. You can also use the built-in terminal in VS Code for convenient access to Docker commands.

### Step 6: Managing Your Drupal Site

1. **Install Drupal Modules**:
   - Use Composer to install any additional Drupal modules you need.
   ```bash
   composer require drupal/module_name
   ```

2. **Access the Drupal Admin**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/user/login` to access the Drupal admin interface and start configuring your site.

### Step 7: Test and Deploy

1. **Testing Locally**:
   - Ensure everything is running smoothly by testing your Drupal setup in your local environment.

2. **Deploying to Production**:
   - When you are ready to deploy, Lagoon provides great tools for managing different environments like production and staging.

That's it! With Lagoon, Docker, Ubuntu, VS Code, and Drupal Core, you've got a robust setup to build and develop your "ay-tech" project. Happy coding and best of luck with your Drupal journey!
